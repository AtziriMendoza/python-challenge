In this repo, I was able to take a deep dive into loops with python and how to use these loops to properly analyze both PyBank data (finance data regarding profit and losses) and PyPoll data (data regarding an election). For PyBank I had to do the following:
-The total number of months included in the dataset -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period -The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period -The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
For PyPoll I had to do the following: -The total number of votes cast -A complete list of candidates who received votes -The percentage of votes each candidate won -The total number of votes each candidate won -The winner of the election based on popular vote

All of my completed work can be found in the Starter Code folder, the files with the code will be labeled PyBankFinal and PyPollFinal. The outputs of each file will be in a .gitkeep under the analysis folder.
